				<h1>Bar near shooting says police "staffed next to our business" engaged the gunman</h1>
				

				<p><br>Ned Peppers, the Dayton bar near where the shooting occurred, posted a statement Sunday on Facebook.</p><br>

				<p>"[T]he shooter started down the road and made his way towards our business. We have police regularly staffed next to our business who engaged the shooter and neutralized the threat.
				"Dayton Police could not have done a better job responding to this senseless act of violence. We cannot commend them high enough," they wrote.</p><br>

				<p>Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley said earlier that none of the shooting occurred inside the bar, all the shootings occurred outside.</p> <br>

				<p>Here is the full statement from Ned Peppers:</p><br>

				<p>First and foremost our thoughts are with the victims of this tragedy. We are shaken and confused as to why this occurred in our safe entertainment district located in downtown Dayton. We are following along with you of the news coverage from WHIO, the shooter started down the road and made his way towards our business. We have police regularly staffed next to our business who engaged the shooter and neutralized the threat. Dayton Police could not have done a better job responding to this senseless act of violence. We cannot commend them high enough. We are assisting them still in every way we can in their investigation. Clothing items left here have been placed in the rear of our building although the area is still closed until further notice. We do not know at this time when the area or our business will open.</p><br>
